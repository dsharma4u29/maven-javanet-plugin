  <p>
    The <code>javanet:genapp</code> goal generates a skeleton for a java.net project. It sets up mailing lists, source repository information, issue tracking URL, and a few other things according to the java.net project layout. It also set properties up so that you can use other maven java.net plugin goals.

  <p>
    Currently this goal doesn't perform the <tt>javanet:register-repository</tt> goal, but perhaps it should.
