  <p>
    The <code>javanet:genapp</code> goal generates a skeleton for a java.net project. It sets up mailing lists, source repository information, issue tracking URL, and a few other things according to the java.net project layout. It also set properties up so that you can use other maven java.net plugin goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    This goal doesn't perform the <a href="register-repository.html"><tt>javanet:register-repository</tt></a> goal, so you need to run it separately, when you are ready to deploy your artifacts.
