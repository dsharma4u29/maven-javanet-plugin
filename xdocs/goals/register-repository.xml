<section name="Registering your project with java.net maven repository">
  <p>
    The <code>javanet:register-repository</code> goal performs a registration of your project to <a href="https://maven-repository.dev.java.net/">the java.net-wide maven repository</a>. This goal only needs to be run once per one project, and within an hour or so, you'll receive an e-mail confirming your registration.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the registration is complete, you can start using the <a href="deploy.html">javanet:deploy-XXX</a> goals to push artifacts into the repository.
