    The <code>javanet:site</code> goal uploads the artifacts of the <code>site:generate</code> goal into your project's web area by importing those files into the <code>www/maven</code> folder of your CVS/Subversion. The uploaded contents can be accessed as <code>http://yourproject.dev.java.net/nonav/maven/</code>.
  </p>

<section name="Note">
  <p>
    In CVS-based java.net projects, the web contents are connected to the CVS repository, and whenever a content is updated, the server runs an automated program to update the web contents. This updater has a bug in it that it doesn't recognize the CVS import command as a trigger. To work around this problem, invoking this goal adds a new file <code>www/.java.net.updater</code> into your repository.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Subversion-based java.net projects, the automated program runs asynchronously from <tt>svn commit</tt>. So there seems to be certain delay between the time the commit operation completes and the time the contents become visible.

    To use this goal with the multiproject plugin, put the following definition to your <tt>mave.xml</tt>
